# PUI-HW5
PUI Homework 5: Mock website Fluff Stuff with 3 functional screens.

Used CSS framework Bootstrap for the entire website. 
Used basic starter bootstrap template as jumping off point (https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/examples/carousel/)
Website uses very simply javascript for tooltip hovering in the product details page and simple alerts when products are added to cart.
